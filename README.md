fizz buzz woof
===============

   The number 3 becomes Fizz, 5 becomes Buzz, and 7 becomes Woof. The main rules in this game are that any number that contains the number or is divisible by that number is replaced by an occurrence of the word. If the number has 2 instances of that number (i.e. 33 or 55) and is divisible by that number, then the word is said three times in this example. The additional rule is that the words (if more than one occur) must be said in the order given in the title.
